# spectogram-snapper
Spectogram snapper - program for recording human spectograms and other embodied quantifications

Basically this program takes your webcam and uses it to take a 'panaromic' style image, imposing a scale over the top of it.

It needs:
  * ffmpeg
  * gd
  * tk
  * perl including tk and gd modules

Will keep updating, might even make it not a total mess. Good luck getting it working :)
